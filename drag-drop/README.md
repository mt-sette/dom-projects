# Drag and drop boxes

In order for an element to be draggable, an attribute of `draggable="true"` has to be added to each element that requires this functionality

Drag and drop is possible by using the `ondragstart`, `ondragover`, `ondrop` and `ondragend` events. All of this is done by using JavaScript.

Correctly adding and removing classes to the elements that are being dragged and dropped.
